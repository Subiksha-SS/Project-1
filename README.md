### Visualising crime by racial descent
Our dataset breaks down the victims of crime into 19 separate racial categories. In order to make our visualisations more tractable we reduced these to 8 groupings; this would also allow us to see more clearly if crimes against those of Asian ethnicity was especially pronounced during the COVID period, as the original data contained several different Asian ethnicities. We used pie charts and bar charts for each year to try and identify any changes in composition of crimes by racial descent. We found that the composition in question stayed stable for the period of study under analysis and that there were no major spikes in crime against a particular ethnic group. We used US census data for the city of Los Angeles when looking for these kinds of discrepancies.
