## Motivating Questions for analysis
What is the trend in crime during different times of day, split evenly between 4 brackets - Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night.

Does age, sex, or racial descent play a factor in the occurance of crime, whether its violent or non-violent

Where is crime committed (its concentation) 


### Frequency of crimes occurred during different time frames throughout the day from 2020 to 2023 
The historian bar chart and density plot represent the frequency of crimes that occurred during different time frames throughout the day for 2020-2023. The x-axis is divided into four bins representing night, morning, afternoon, and evening, while the y-axis shows the frequency of crimes for each time frame. The density plot complements the bar chart by showing the distribution of crime frequencies across the time frames. It provides a visual representation of how the data is distributed and helps to highlight the peak period during the afternoon.

During the night, the frequency of crimes was relatively low, indicating that fewer incidents occurred during this time period. As the day progressed, the frequency of crimes started to increase from morning to afternoon. The most frequent and repeatable time for crimes was during the afternoon, suggesting that this was a peak period for criminal activity.
However, after the afternoon peak, the frequency of crimes began to decline during the evening. This decrease in crime incidents during the evening indicates a possible decrease in criminal activity as the day comes to an end.

Overall, this historian bar chart and density plot provide valuable insights into the patterns of criminal activity. The pattern of crime frequency decreasing during the night and rising from morning to afternoon, with the afternoon being the most frequent time, followed by a decline during the evening, can help law enforcement in understanding and potentially in addressing crime trends during specific time frames.

The historian bar and density plot are also provided for each year of 2020,2021,2022, and 2023. As is shown, each year follows the pattern same as the overall trend (2020-2023), confirming the mentioned conclusion and results.


### Visualising crime by racial descent
Our dataset breaks down the victims of crime into 19 separate racial categories. In order to make our visualisations more tractable we reduced these to 8 groupings; this would also allow us to see more clearly if crimes against those of Asian ethnicity was especially pronounced during the COVID period, as the original data contained several different Asian ethnicities. We used pie charts and bar charts for each year to try and identify any changes in composition of crimes by racial descent. We found that the composition in question stayed stable for the period of study under analysis and that there were no major spikes in crime against a particular ethnic group. We used US census data for the city of Los Angeles when looking for these kinds of discrepancies.  

### Visualising crime by age and sex
### Age
Our dataset has victims from 2 to 99 years of age. The ages were put into 10 bins to help visual and concise the data to work with. Bar graphs for each year (2020 - 2023) were created to display the number of victims in each age group. Scatter plots were created for each year (2020 - 2023) and linear regression analysis was performed on them to determine if there is any correlation between the age and the number of victims of crime. Graphs were created for each year to see if there were any changes in victim age through the 3.5 years (Covid period).

### Sex
The data set contains victims of 3 different sex, Male, Female and Unknown. The victims based on sex were visualized in pie charts for each year to see if a particular sex is more likely to be a victim of crime, specifically females. The pie charts showed that there is an almost equal ratio of male and female victims and there is no significant difference between them.


### Visualising crime by location
Within the Ryan_Location_Analysis python notebook file, the location analysis will can be seen. Our group decided to produce a heat map to visualize the concentration of crime in LA.
